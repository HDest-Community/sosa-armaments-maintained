# SoSA Armaments, Maintained

_Requires [BulletLib - Recasted](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HDBulletLib-Recasted), by the HDest Community._

This mod aims to collect and maintain the weapons made by Popguy12.

## Weapons

### SoSA-450 "Mauler"

A concept weapon built entirely with the idea of being stupid inefficient but fun to use. The SoSA-450 is a box magazine-fed LMG firing shotgun shells. The SoSA-450A1, produced at a later time and only sold elsewhere, is an improvment on its predecessor, made with adjustable barrel choke, but most operators decided to usually leave it low for crowd control. The SoSA-450A2 improved even further with the ability to load other shell loads such as slugs.

#### Notes

- The loadout codes are `jm0` and `jmb` for weapon and mag, respectively.
- `choke` is modifiable just like the Hunter.
- Future versions will have the ability to load shell types from other mods

### SoSA-45A1 "Nora.45R1"

A compact handgun made by SoSA, the NORA.45R1 has proven to be a powerful and reliable sidearm. Built on the Colt M1911 pattern, the NORA.45R1 fixes an issue many operators had with the M1911: its single stacked magazine. Along with some improvements to the materials used in the parts, the NORA.45R1 is fitted with a 15-round, doublestack .45 ACP magazine. Outside of its militar designation, it is known as the “SoSA-45A1.”

#### Notes

- The loadout codes are `s45` and `m45` for weapon and mag, respectively.
